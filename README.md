# YACoVV - Yet Another (SARS-)CoV(-2)Ventilator

This Project aims to develop Ventilator Modules that can be used as last resort Device for SARS-CoV-2 Patients.

All modules should be buildable with parts, materials and skills that are available close to the locations where the ventilators are needed.

Currently we have developed a working prototype for a ventilator pressure regulator achiving the goal of getting constant, adjustable PIns and PExp Pressures with widely avalable Parts.
