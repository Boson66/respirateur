# YACoVV - Yet Another (SARS-)CoV(-2)Ventilator

[German-Version is more Detailed / updated more frequently](README_DE.md) <- Please translate (see Contributing)!

This Project aims to develop Ventilator Modules that can be used as last resort Device for SARS-CoV-2 Patients.

All modules should be buildable with parts, materials and skills that are available close to the locations where the ventilators are needed.

Currently we have developed a working prototype for a ventilator pressure regulator achiving the goal of getting constant, adjustable PIns and PExp Pressures with widely available Parts.

## Contributing
Contributions to the project are very welcome! Everything needs to be done NOW, dont tell us that you could contribute something DO IT!

If the project ends up in a competition like the [Code Life Ventilator Challenge](https://www.agorize.com/en/challenges/code-life-challenge?lang=en) all prizes will be used to build actual ventilators / optimize the design.

Things that would be of great Help
- Translation of the README_DE File to English / Spain / Hindi / Persian /  ...
- Build a YACoVV and let it run / report your problems and what could be done better
- Pick a Issue from the github issue and start working on it
